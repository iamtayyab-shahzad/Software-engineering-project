\section{Software Development Methodology}
The \textbf{Agile development methodology} will be adopted for this project. The methodology is chosen as it supports \textbf{incremental progress} with continuous iterations. The project is developed in various short sprints, with each sprint focused on a specific task such as proposal generation. 

This development methodology ensures \textbf{flexibility}, adaptability to changes, and helps maintain a high-quality product. It also promotes \textbf{collaboration with stakeholders} through regular meetings to verify and validate the system’s performance and progress.

\section{Project Objective}
The primary objective of the \textbf{Upwork Assistant} project is to design and develop an \textbf{intelligent application} that will help freelancers prepare more effective job proposals on the \textbf{Upwork platform}. The system will automatically \textbf{analyze client profiles}, assess client reliability based on parameters such as hiring rate and budget history, and generate personalized proposal templates using data from previous successful submissions. 

This system mainly focuses on saving freelancers’ time, enhancing the quality of their proposals, and increasing their chances of winning projects through intelligent, data-driven recommendations.
