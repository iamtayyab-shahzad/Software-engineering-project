## Project Description
Upwork Proposal Assistant is a software system developed to assist freelancers in analyzing Upwork job postings and client profiles before submitting proposals. The system evaluates client-related factors such as hiring history, feedback records, job success rate, and budget behavior to assess client reliability.

Based on this analysis, the system generates structured and customizable proposal drafts using predefined templates and historical success data. It also provides decision-support recommendations to help freelancers decide whether applying for a specific job is worthwhile. The main goal of the system is to reduce proposal writing time, improve decision-making, and increase proposal success rates.

The project follows standard software engineering practices and is documented according to IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS) guidelines.

## System Scope
The system focuses on:
- Client profile analysis
- Proposal template generation
- Freelancer decision support
- Administrative management of templates and system data

The system does not automatically submit proposals. Final submission remains the responsibility of the freelancer.

## UI Prototypes (Figma)
The user interface of the system has been designed using Figma. The prototypes represent the workflow and interactions for both user roles.
