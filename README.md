## Project Description
Upwork Proposal Assistant is a software system designed to assist freelancers in analyzing Upwork job postings and client profiles before submitting proposals. The system evaluates multiple client-related factors such as hiring behavior, feedback history, job success rate, and budget patterns to determine client reliability.

Based on this analysis, the system generates structured and customizable proposal drafts using predefined templates and historical success data. Additionally, the system provides decision support recommendations to help freelancers determine whether applying for a particular job is beneficial. The primary objective of the system is to reduce proposal writing time, improve decision-making, and increase proposal success rates.

This project is being developed following standard software engineering practices and documented according to IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS) guidelines.

## System Scope
The system focuses on:
- Client profile analysis
- Proposal template generation
- Freelancer decision support
- Administrative management of templates and system data

The system does not submit proposals automatically; final submission remains the responsibility of the freelancer.

## UI Prototypes (Figma)
The system user interface has been designed using Figma. The prototypes represent the visual flow and interaction of both user roles.
